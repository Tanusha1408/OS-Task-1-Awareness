    <b>--WAYS TO INCREASE AWARENESS--</b>
<br><br>
    

    <b>SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE</b><br><br>

Engage your neighborhood, family, and friends in a dialogue about urgent problems, and relevant topics once you’ve educated yourself on them.

You are not only increasing environmental awareness but also finding possibilities to join in communal initiatives or get interested in other connected issues by including your community in the discourse.<br><br><br>

    <b>INCLUDE LESSONS IN SCHOOLS</b><br><br>

When it comes to raising environmental awareness, including environmental topics into school curricula is an excellent place to start. 

Here are some helpful hints to get you started:

Teach youngsters how to reduce waste, reuse resources, and recycle items using the three Rs.
Arrange for tree-planting days at school and teach students about the importance of trees to the ecosystem.
Encourage your children to turn off all lights and appliances when they are not in use.
Ensure that taps are properly closed after children have used them, and that water is used sparingly. <br><br><br>

     <b>ATTEND A RALLY OR MARCH</b><br><br>

<img src="https://www.tenereteam.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pasted-image-1-12-1200x799.png" class="img"></center><br>


A strike might be a good technique to get people’s attention. Consider the People’s Climate March in Washington, D.C. in 2017. In 2019, millions of people from all over the world gathered in their individual nations ahead of the United Nations’ Climate Action Summit. These incidents drew a lot of attention from the media.

If you can’t locate a demonstration or march that you want to join, talk to people about organizing your own. Climate change advocates may be found almost anywhere, so you won’t have to look hard to discover those who want to assist. To ensure a large turnout, make sure to promote your event early and regularly. <br><br><br>

     <b>RECOMMEND BOOKS AND MOVIES</b><br><br>
Climate change isn’t always simple to comprehend. This phenomenon has no direct visible, audible, or tactile effects on humans. The earth may be getting warmer and warmer each day, but to the typical individual, this isn’t very noteworthy. By recommending various media, such as books and movies to everyone you know, you can substantially raise their overall awareness about the dire environmental situations we’re currently facing.<br><br><br>

     <b>USE SOCIAL MEDIA</b><br><br>

<img src="https://www.tenereteam.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pasted-image-2-9.png" class="img"></center><br>

We are all aware of the influence of social media. These platforms may be used to assist you in reaching out to a wider audience. Likes, comments, and shares may appear insignificant, yet they have a huge impact on the mindset of an average person. One tweet is all it takes to alter your mind on something, it’s that easy!<br><br><br>

    <b>IMPLEMENT GREEN STRATEGIES</b><br><br>

If you run a business, you must develop and implement a green plan. This is critical even if your company does not technically deal with the environment, such as a tree surgeon. Below are a few effective green strategies you can try:<br>
<br>
  PLANS FOR RECYCLING<br><br>
Recycling programs are a simple yet efficient way to cut waste.<br>

This should include providing a recycling container at the workplace and encouraging employees to utilize it. Although most individuals want to recycle, the issue is determining what can be recycled and what’s not.<br><br><br>

<b>--Investing In Reusable Items--</b><br><br>
Metal water bottles, plastic lunch boxes, and reusable coffee cups should all be used at work. To increase environmental awareness, businesses may choose to supply their staff with their own branded reusable things. Allbirds is among the most famous stores that provide footwear from 100 percent recycled materials. Check it out if you’re someone who’s interested in recycling and sustainable products.<br><br><br>


    <b>DISCONNECTING APPLIANCES</b><br><br>

<img src="https://www.tenereteam.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pasted-image-3-8-1200x900.png" class="img"></center><br>

We’re all guilty of it. We put PCs on standby overnight so that everything is ready when you arrive at work the next day. Likewise, we also leave plugs in sockets with the light on but nothing plugged in. Your company should make this obvious and encourage you to switch off all appliances and lights before leaving the office. They may set a positive example for others by making sure that all electrical appliances are turned off once everyone has left.<br><br><br>

  
   <br> <br>

  
   Awareness of climate change and other environmental concerns has increased in the last few decades, thanks in part to documentaries like "An Inconvenient Truth" and the popularity of Earth Day. However, there is still a lot of work to be done to increase public awareness, particularly in underdeveloped countries. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has outlined several key ways to increase awareness of environmental issues worldwide.<br><br>
The Earth is getting warmer each day due to our own wrongdoings. Therefore, we must do everything in our power to save our home planet, as well as recover the damages we’ve done throughout the centuries. However, understanding how to act is only the first step. These are excellent approaches to begin raising environmental awareness, yet we must put that information into practice.<br>
